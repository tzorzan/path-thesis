@Inproceedings {stmapmatching,
	abstract = {<p>Map-matching is the process of aligning a sequence of observed user positions
                with the road network on a digital map. It is a fundamental pre-processing step
                for many applications, such as moving object management, traffic flow analysis,
                and driving directions. In practice there exists huge amount of low-sampling-rate
                (e.g., one point every 2-5 minutes) GPS trajectories. Unfortunately, most current
                map-matching approaches only deal with high-sampling-rate (typically one point
                every 10-30s) GPS data, and become less effective for low-sampling-rate points as
                the uncertainty in data increases. In this paper, we propose a novel global
                map-matching algorithm called ST-Matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories.
                ST-Matching considers (1) the spatial geometric and topological structures of the
                road network and (2) the temporal/speed constraints of the trajectories. Based on
                spatio-temporal analysis, a candidate graph is constructed from which the best
                matching path sequence is identified. We compare ST-Matching with the incremental
                algorithm and Average-Fr{\'e}chet-Distance (AFD) based global map-matching algorithm.
                The experiments are performed both on synthetic and real dataset. The results
                show that our ST-matching algorithm significantly outperform incremental
                algorithm in terms of matching accuracy for low-sampling trajectories. Meanwhile,
                when compared with AFD-based global algorithm, ST-Matching also improves accuracy
                as well as running time.</p>},
